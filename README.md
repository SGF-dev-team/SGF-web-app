# SGI-web-app

The aim of this project is to produce a cross platform looking for group app or LFG for short. It is called Gate Link LFG and will be aimed at gamers so will have a number of functions that will allow users to find other players on their platform and game so that they can play together. We are currently working on a web app that will have feeds showing who is looking for a group and allow users to filter the feeds to find what they are looking for.

This project is a group project, though it was started by SS-git-dev.
