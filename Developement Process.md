### Starting a task
- when you decide you want to start a task.
  - assign yourself to the issue
  - move the task from "to do" to "in progress"

### Working on a task
- branch off of the main "master" branch
- name the new branch the issue name
- make the other developers as reviewers

### When you think you're done
- create a pull request
- at least one other developer has to approve it, preferably two developers
- once they have approved the branch, assign it to either the senior dev or the project owner, or manager. 
- they will then handle the merging, unless they give approval for you to do it. 

### Once the branch is merged
- move the task to the "done" column
- close the issue assigned with it


### If you need help, or have quetions: CREATE AN ISSUE
- create an issue in the repo
- add the "questions" label, along with all the other relavent tags
- post the issue link in the "project-issue-help" channel of the discord with a small summary of what you're stuck on specifically
- if this is an urgent issue, tag the team to get everyone's attention
